# hello-world
Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

This is my hello world try. To be familiar with Github.

The python file is to sign up the NexusHD website automatically. And the code considers the exception. If it can't connect the Internet, it will stop and tell the user what has happened. If you have signned up, then it will close and tell you that you have signned up already.
